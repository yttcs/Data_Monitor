# Data_Monitor

# Monitor a data file for any updates by polling the file for download, at some time increment, and comparing it with the last downloaded version. If there is an update (i.e., a change in the newest file) then create a visualization of the new data and send an email notification with the new visualization as an attachment. In addition, send an sms message notification of the email. 

To do:

Delete each downloaded file that results in no update to avoid taking up storage space.
